I made the decision to deviate from my IA diagram since some of what was decided
upon in my IA diagram was cut from the completed project. This was done because
I lack both pictures of myself and any sort of video I would use for an introduction.
The same can be said with the map of locations of countries I've visited, because it
wouldn't really fit in with any other portion of the site that currently exists, so
I made the executive decision to leave it out.

Also, I felt that job experience would better fit under the Resume portion than
the Professional Information section.

References were cut for the time being because I lacked tangible references that
I could rely upon.

Tools were removed from the portfolio section because I felt that they detracted
from the overall impact of the portfolio section. Instead I tried to highlight my
past work and include the tools I worked with during that section.
