          Currently unnamed, the site will focus heavily on the projects Richard has worked on in the past few years, with an emphasis on projects that he was essential to. Both samples of his work and his resume will be readily available and easily accessible for recruiters. Richard also accepts freelance work, so a portion of the site will be devoted to attracting clients.
